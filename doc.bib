	abstract = {This paper presents Prio, a privacy-preserving system for the
	            collection of aggregate statistics. Each Prio client holds a
	            private data value (e.g., its current location), and a small set
	            of servers compute statistical functions over the values of all
	            clients (e.g., the most popular location). As long as at least
	            one server is honest, the Prio servers learn nearly nothing about
	            the clients' private data, except what they can infer from the
	            aggregate statistics that the system computes. To protect
	            functionality in the face of faulty or malicious clients, Prio
	            uses secret-shared non-interactive proofs (SNIPs), a new
	            cryptographic technique that yields a hundred-fold performance
	            improvement over conventional zero-knowledge approaches. Prio
	            extends classic private aggregation techniques to enable the
	            collection of a large class of useful statistics. For example,
	            Prio can perform a least-squares regression on high-dimensional
	            client-provided data without ever seeing the data in the clear.},
